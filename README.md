## <a id="Calling_CNV_R"></a> CONICSmat - Identifying CNVs from scRNA-seq using a count table 

CONICSmat is an R package that can be used to identify CNVs in single cell RNA-seq data from a gene expression table, without the need of an explicit normal control dataset. CONICSmat works with either full transcript (e.g. Fluidigm C1) or 5'/3' tagged (e.g. 10X Genomics) data. A tutorial on how to use CONICSmat, and a Smart-Seq2 dataset, can be found [on the CONICSmat Wiki page [CLICK here]](https://github.com/diazlab/CONICS/wiki/Tutorial---CONICSmat;---Dataset:-SmartSeq2-scRNA-seq-of-Oligodendroglioma).

  * [samtools](http://www.htslib.org)
  * [bedtools](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest)  


### Config file

  ```

In the manuscript, the number of false positive CNV calls was calculated using a non-malignant [fetal brain dataset](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.004). These data are independent from the [training set](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67835)

### Config file
Adjust __Empirical_validation.cfg__ to change the following:
  * Paths to python/samtools/bedtools/Rscript
  * Thresholds for mapping-quality and read count
  * FDR for CNV calling

### Running

  ```
  bash run_empirical_validation.sh [directory for train] [directory for test] [.bed files for CNV segments] [base name]
  ```

  * __[directory for train]__: path to directory containing aligned bam files of scRNA-seq data used as a control to call CNVs
    
  * __[directory for test]__: path to directory containing aligned bam files of scRNA-seq data known not to have CNVs, used as a gold standard.
   
  * __[BED file for CNV segments]__ : same as described in run_CONICS.sh

### Output
Box plot of FDRs will be generated (__boxplot.pdf__) in the output directory.
